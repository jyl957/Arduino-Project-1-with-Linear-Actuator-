# Arduino-Project-1-with-Linear-Actuator-
the autocontrol system of linear actuator by using Arduino, Ultrasonic sensor and SR-Latch.This is an automatic system by using linear actuator, Arduino, Ultrasonic sensor and SR-Latch. This system can be used to control the valve. Compared with traditional control system by using infrared sensor, this system can hold opening position without keeping the hand in front of the sensor. The linear actuator will push valve to a new position when the distance between your hands and sensor is larger than 2cm and less than 9cm. The linear actuator will push valve back to the original position when the distance is larger than 9cm and less than 16cm.
